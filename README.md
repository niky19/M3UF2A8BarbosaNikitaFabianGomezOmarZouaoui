# M3 UF2 A8 - Tetris Game

## Overview

This project implements a simple version of the classic game Tetris in Kotlin made for our school project. The inspiration for this project comes from the original Tetris created by Alekséi Pázhitnov in 1984. The game involves manipulating falling pieces to create complete horizontal lines, which then disappear, and the player scores points.

## Background

On June 6, 1984, Alekséi Pázhitnov, a Russian computer engineer, developed Tetris while working for the government. Due to the circumstances of its creation, the profits from the game went to the Russian government, and Pázhitnov received no financial benefit. In 1991, he moved to the United States and later collaborated with Microsoft in 1996 for the development of Xbox 360. Despite efforts to recover the copyright, various free source versions of Tetris had already gained popularity.

## Features

- **Dynamic Game Board:** The program prompts the user for the size of the game board.
  
- **Random Piece Generation:** The game generates random Tetris pieces that cannot be rotated.

- **Piece Movement:** The player can move the pieces to right direction before dropping them.

- **Line Completion:** When a horizontal line is completely filled, it disappears, and the pieces above fall down.
  
- **Score:** Each time a line is filled you score a point!

- **End Condition:** The game ends when a piece reaches the upper limit of the table.
